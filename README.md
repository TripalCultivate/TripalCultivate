# Tripal Cultivate: Base Module

**Developed by the University of Saskatchewan, Pulse Crop Bioinformatics team.**

<!-- Summarize the main features of this package in point form below. -->

- Provides the Tripal Cultivate ontology to Tripal. This provides well described terms for germplasm types, breeding methods, metadata and relationships. 
- Provides a package dashboard on the Tripal Extensions listing for a unified entry point into administration of Tripal Cultivate. We plan for it to include:
   - Charts summarizing content across data types
   - Quick links to data-specific configuration
   - Status views (e.g. most recent data upload, if there is unpublished data)
- Any additional functionality which is shared among the data type specific modules.
